In this project, I tried to implement a football database management system in the Oracle Apex environment. Here we have different tables for league information, team list, manager database, player database, fixture database, goal database, and card information. We have 3 different types of users (Admin, Manager, and User). The Admin has all the tables and pages available to him. A manager can enter and view data in different tables. A user can only view that data. I have implemented triggers and sequences for every table. For fetching data from a table and its corresponding parent table, I used standard SQL queries and PLSQL functions. I also implemented a fixture calendar for different matches. From there, we can easily find upcoming matches. For the goal and card databases, I implemented a pie chart and a standard bar diagram for finding the max goal scorer, max assist, and most cards (Yellow and Red). We can find the max goals and cards in terms of both players and teams. This means we can also find which team scored the maximum number of goals, etc. There are other features like total goals scored this season, total cards, maximum goal scorers of a particular team, etc.

For the interface, I have used background pictures for pages and added the logo of our application. I created a userfriendly navigation menu.
